# Role
You are a Senior Frontend Architect and an Award-Winning UI/UX Designer specializing in high-conversion landing pages. You are an expert in Nuxt 4, Tailwind CSS, and advanced animations (GSAP or VueUse/Motion).

# Project Goal
Create a visually stunning, "One-Page" high-performance landing page for a ride-hailing app called "Tagsi". The primary goal is to drive users to download the app from Google Play Store and Apple App Store. The design must be energetic, trustworthy, and heavily animated, mimicking the simplicity and modern feel of the Uber interface but with a unique brand identity.

# Tech Stack
- Framework: Nuxt 4 (Latest)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (v4 if available, otherwise v3)
- Icons: Lucide-Vue or Iconify
- Animations: @vueuse/motion or GSAP (for scroll-triggered and complex animations)
- SEO: Nuxt SEO Kit (Schema.org, Robots, Sitemaps)

# Design Guidelines (Brand Identity)
- **Primary Color:** Taxi Yellow (Extract from logo: approx. #FFC107 or #FFD600).
- **Secondary Color:** Dark Charcoal / Black (#1A1A1A) for contrast.
- **Accent Color:** White (for glassmorphism cards).
- **Typography:** 'Inter' or 'Poppins' (Google Fonts) – Bold, readable, modern.
- **Vibe:** Urban, fast, fluid, tech-forward. Use the curved arrow from the logo as a recurring design motif (e.g., directional cues, scroll indicators).

# Section Breakdown (Single Page Scroll)

1. **Header (Sticky & Glassmorphism):**
   - Logo on the left (Tagsi).
   - "Driver" and "Passenger" toggles.
   - Prominent "Download App" button (pulsing animation).

2. **Hero Section (Above the Fold):**
   - **Background:** A stylized, animated map of a city (dark mode style) with moving yellow dots (cars) representing the Tagsi network.
   - **Headline:** Large, bold text: "Şehrin Yeni Ritmi: Tagsi." (The New Rhythm of the City).
   - **Sub-headline:** "Tek dokunuşla çağır, güvenle git. Uber konforu, yerli güç."
   - **Visual:** A high-quality 3D mock-up of a phone showing the Tagsi app interface, floating with a slight parallax effect.
   - **CTA:** Two large, distinct buttons for App Store and Google Play.

3. **How It Works (The "Uber" Logic):**
   - A step-by-step vertical timeline or horizontal cards.
   - Step 1: "Konumunu Seç" (Pin animation on a map).
   - Step 2: "Tagsi Çağır" (Car arrival animation).
   - Step 3: "Keyfine Bak" (Smile/Rating animation).
   - Use scroll-triggered fade-ins for each step.

4. **Features (Why Tagsi?):**
   - Grid layout (Bento Grid style) showing:
     - "Canlı Takip" (Live Tracking).
     - "Güvenli Ödeme" (Credit Card icon).
     - "7/24 Destek" (Headset icon).
   - Cards should have a hover effect (scale up + shadow yellow glow).

5. **Driver Recruitment (Secondary Goal):**
   - A distinct section with a contrasting background (Yellow background, Black text).
   - "Sürücümüz Olun" (Become a Driver).
   - Short form or redirect button to the Driver App.

6. **SEO & Geo-Location Strategy (Invisible but Critical):**
   - **Footer:** Include dynamic keywords like "İstanbul Taksi", "İzmir Ulaşım", "Hızlı Taksi Uygulaması".
   - **Meta Tags:** Generate comprehensive meta tags for OG (Open Graph), Twitter Cards.
   - **Schema:** Add `SoftwareApplication` and `LocalBusiness` JSON-LD schema referencing the Play Store link.
   - **Robots.txt:** Create a standard strict configuration allowing all mostly, but blocking bad bots.

7. **Call to Action (Footer):**
   - A large, final "Ready to ride?" section.
   - QR Code scanning animation that links to the store.

# Implementation Steps

1. **Setup:** Initialize a Nuxt 4 project. Configure Tailwind CSS and Motion.
2. **Assets:** create placeholder SVGs for the Logo (Yellow text 'Tag', White text 'si', Black curved arrow).
3. **Components:** Build the Hero, Features, and Download components separately.
4. **Animation:** Apply `v-motion-slide-visible-bottom` to text and `v-motion-pop-visible` to buttons. Ensure the "Arrow" motif guides the user down the page.
5. **SEO:** Implement the `useHead` composable in Nuxt for dynamic titles and descriptions targeting "Taksi çağırma uygulaması" keywords.

# Coding Instructions
- Write clean, modular Vue components (Composition API).
- Ensure the site is fully responsive (Mobile First approach).
- Use semantic HTML5 tags (<section>, <article>, <footer>).
- Create a `robots.txt` file suitable for high SEO visibility.
- **IMPORTANT:** Focus on the "Wow Factor". The UI must feel expensive and fluid.

Start by setting up the project structure and the Hero section.

# Refinement Task: Visual Polish, Links & Animation
Awesome start with the structure! Now, let's transform this skeleton into a high-end, award-winning design.

# 1. Assets & Branding Integration
- **Logo:** Ensure `/logo.png` is displayed correctly in the Header and Footer.
- **The "Arrow" Motif:** Extract the curved arrow shape from the logo concept. Use it as:
  - A subtle background SVG pattern in the "How It Works" section connecting the steps.
  - A bouncing "Scroll Down" indicator at the bottom of the Hero section.
- **Color Palette:** Enforce the strict "Taxi Yellow" (#FFC107) and "Matte Black" (#1A1A1A) theme. Buttons should be Yellow with Black text (High Contrast).

# 2. Link Implementation
Replace all placeholder `#` links with the actual Google Play URL provided:
- **Target URL:** `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tagsi.tagsi_driver_app&hl=en_US`
- Apply this URL to:
  - Header "Download" button.
  - Hero section "Google Play" button.
  - Footer CTA buttons.
  - Note: For the "App Store" button, keep it `#` but add a `onclick="alert('iOS versiyonu çok yakında!')"` for now.

# 3. Hero Section "Wow" Factor
- **Background:** Implement a dark, stylized map background (using a static SVG map or CSS pattern).
- **Animation:** Add "pulsing yellow dots" moving along invisible lines on the map to simulate cars moving. This makes the site feel "alive".
- **Phone Mockup:** Enhance the phone mockup in the Hero. Give it a strong drop-shadow and a floating animation (`y: -10, duration: 2000, yoyo: true`).

# 4. Glassmorphism & UI Cards
- Update the cards in "Features" and "Driver" sections.
- Style: `bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-md border border-white/20`.
- Hover Effect: When hovering over a feature card, the border color should change to Yellow, and the icon should scale up.

# 5. Driver Section Enhancement
- The "Earnings" card (visualizing ₺12,450) is great. Make it animate!
- Count-up animation: When the user scrolls to this section, the number should count up from 0 to 12,450.

# 6. Final SEO Check
- Ensure the `<title>` is dynamically set to "Tagsi - Şehrin Yeni Ritmi | Hızlı Taksi Uygulaması".
- Verify the JSON-LD schema includes the 'SoftwareApplication' type pointing to the Google Play URL.

Apply these changes now to make the site look premium and ready for launch.

# Role
You are the Lead Frontend Developer for the Tagsi project.

# Task Overview
We need to update the application logic to handle "Passenger" vs "Driver" contexts dynamically and inject new marketing content provided by the client.

# 1. State Management & Logic (CRITICAL)
Refactor the state management to handle a global `userType` ('passenger' | 'driver').
- **Default State:** 'passenger'.
- **Header Toggle:** The toggle in the header should update this `userType` state.
- **Header "Download" Button:** - Action: This button should NO LONGER open a link directly.
  - New Action: It must smooth-scroll to the `#download-section` at the bottom of the page.

# 2. Dynamic Download Section (#download-section)
The Download Section must reactively change based on the selected `userType`.
- Show two large buttons: "App Store (iOS)" and "Google Play (Android)".
- **Logic:**
  - IF `userType` === 'passenger':
    - Android Link: `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tagsi.tagsi_app_client&hl=en_US`
    - iOS Link: `#` (Alert: "iOS Yolcu uygulaması yakında!")
  - IF `userType` === 'driver':
    - Android Link: `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tagsi.tagsi_driver_app&hl=en_US`
    - iOS Link: `#` (Alert: "iOS Sürücü uygulaması yakında!")
- **Visual Feedback:** When `userType` changes, use a smooth fade transition to swap the links/text in this section.

# 3. Content Integration (Turkish)
Replace the existing placeholder text with the following finalized content. Ensure appropriate typography and layout.

## Hero Section
- **Headline:** "Hızlı, güvenli ve kolay ulaşım için Tagsi"
- **Sub-headline:** "Şehir içi ulaşımı daha hızlı, daha güvenli ve ekonomik hale getiren modern çözüm. Tek dokunuşla çağır, anlık takip et."

## Features Section (Grid Layout)
Update the feature cards with these titles and descriptions:
1. **Icon: Touch/Phone** | Title: "Kolay Yolculuk Talebi" | Desc: "Uygulamayı aç, konumunu belirle ve yolculuğunu başlat."
2. **Icon: Map/Pin** | Title: "Anlık Konum Takibi" | Desc: "Sürücünün nerede olduğunu canlı harita üzerinden izle."
3. **Icon: Wallet/Card** | Title: "Güvenli Ödeme" | Desc: "Nakit, kredi kartı veya dijital cüzdan seçenekleriyle ödeme yap."
4. **Icon: Star** | Title: "Puanlama Sistemi" | Desc: "Sürücünü değerlendir, deneyimini paylaş ve kaliteye katkı sağla."
5. **Icon: Bell** | Title: "Anlık Bildirimler" | Desc: "Yolculuk onayları ve kampanyalardan anında haberdar ol."
6. **Icon: Shield** | Title: "Güvenlik Önceliği" | Desc: "Her yolculuk, sürücü doğrulama süreçleriyle güvence altındadır."

## "Why Tagsi?" Section
Use a list or check-mark layout for these points:
- "Kullanıcı dostu tasarım ile her yaştan kullanıcı için kolay kullanım."
- "Şeffaf fiyatlandırma, sürpriz ücretler olmadan adil yolculuk."
- "7/24 aktif destek hattı ile güven veren müşteri hizmetleri."
- "Düzenli kampanyalar ve indirimlerle uygun yolculuk fırsatları."

# 4. Refinement
- Ensure the "Driver" specific content (like earnings) is ONLY visible when `userType` is set to 'driver'.
- If `userType` is 'passenger', hide the Driver Recruitment specific blocks or move them to a secondary position.
- Ensure all Google Play links provided above are implemented correctly.

# Role
You are a UI/UX Animation Expert and Senior Vue Developer.

# Task: Implement Light Mode & Gamified Theme Toggle
We need to introduce a "Light Mode" to the application and control it via a unique, custom-designed interactive button fixed at the bottom of the screen.

# 1. The "Taxi Light" Toggle Component
Create a new component `<TaxiThemeToggle />` that acts as the theme switcher.
- **Position:** Fixed at the bottom center of the screen (`fixed bottom-8 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 z-50`).
- **Visual Design (CSS Only):**
  - Shape: A 3D-style Taxi Roof Light (Trapezoid shape with rounded corners), mimicking the uploaded reference image.
  - Text: Inside the lamp, distinct bold text saying "TAGSİ".
  - Color: Taxi Yellow base.
- **Interaction Logic (The "Switch"):**
  - **Dark Mode State (Night):** The Taxi Light is **ON**.
    - Effect: High contrast neon glow (CSS `box-shadow` and `text-shadow`), bright yellow internal color. It looks like a lit taxi sign at night.
  - **Light Mode State (Day):** The Taxi Light is **OFF**.
    - Effect: No glow. It looks like a matte yellow plastic sign under daylight.
- **Animation:**
  - When clicked, play a "flicker" animation (like a fluorescent lamp turning on/off) before switching the theme.
  - Smooth transition for the background colors.

# 2. Light Mode Color Palette (Day Theme)
Define the Tailwind styles for the Light Mode (`html:not(.dark)`).
- **Background:** Very light grey/off-white (`#F3F4F6` or `#FAFAFA`) instead of black.
- **Text:** Dark Charcoal (`#1A1A1A`) for readability.
- **Cards/Glassmorphism:**
  - Update card backgrounds to be `bg-white/60` with a subtle dark border/shadow to ensure they pop against the light background.
  - Ensure the "Yellow" brand color remains the primary accent in both modes.

# 3. Implementation Details
- **State Management:** Use a composable (or Nuxt's `useColorMode`) to handle the toggle.
- **Persistence:** Save the user's preference to `localStorage`.
- **Transitions:** Add `transition-colors duration-500` to the `<body>` or main layout so the switch between Black and White backgrounds is smooth, not jarring.

# Coding Instructions
1. **Update `tailwind.config`:** Ensure `darkMode: 'class'` is enabled.
2. **Create `TaxiThemeToggle.vue`:** Use advanced CSS for the 3D lamp effect. Use pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) to create the depth/base of the lamp.
3. **Refactor Layout:** Inject this component into `layouts/default.vue` so it appears on every page.
4. **Fix Contrast:** Check all white text in the current Dark Mode design and ensure it turns dark in Light Mode (using `text-white dark:text-white text-gray-900` logic).

Make the toggle look "juicy" and satisfying to click!

-seo Geo
Role: Senior AI Optimization (AIO) & Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Specialist.
Context: We have an existing web platform serving the Turkish market. Standard SEO (technical & on-page) is already completed.
Objective: Implement a comprehensive AIO/GEO strategy to maximize visibility and citation frequency in AI-powered search engines (ChatGPT/SearchGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Gemini, Claude).

Based on the latest 2025/2026 research on LLM retrieval behaviors (RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation), please execute the following 4-step optimization plan for my project:

### STEP 1: TECHNICAL AIO CONFIGURATION (The "Crawlability" Layer)
AIs crawl differently than Googlebot. Update my technical stack:
1.  **AI-Specific Robots.txt:** Generate a `robots.txt` file that explicitly allows access to emerging AI user agents while blocking harmful scrapers.
    * *Must Allow:* `GPTBot`, `ChatGPT-User`, `Google-Extended`, `ClaudeBot`, `Applebot-Extended`, `PerplexityBot`.
2.  **LLM-Ready Sitemaps:** Create a strategy for a high-frequency updated sitemap strictly for high-value informational content (FAQs, Knowledge Base) to signal "Freshness" (a key Perplexity ranking factor).
3.  **Context Windows Optimization:** Analyze my page structure. Redesign the HTML DOM order so that the "Answer" to the user's potential query appears in the first 1000 tokens of the HTML render.

### STEP 2: STRUCTURED DATA & ENTITY GRAPH (The "Understanding" Layer)
LLMs understand "Entities," not just keywords.
1.  **JSON-LD Expansion:** Write advanced Schema.org markup code tailored for the Turkish market (`"inLanguage": "tr-TR"`).
    * *Required Schemas:* `Organization` (with `sameAs` linking to all social profiles to build the Knowledge Graph), `FAQPage` (crucial for Direct Answers), `Article` (with `author` distinctiveness), and `Service`.
2.  **Citation Support:** In the Schema, specifically use the `citation` and `mentions` properties to link out to authoritative Turkish government (.gov.tr) or academic (.edu.tr) sources. This builds the "Trust Web" required for GEO.

### STEP 3: CONTENT RE-ENGINEERING FOR GEO (The "Quotation" Layer)
Refactor my content strategy based on "Generative Engine Optimization" principles to increase the likelihood of being cited as a source.
1.  **The "Direct Answer" Format:** Rewrite content headers to be questions (Natural Language Queries). Immediately follow the header with a concise, direct answer (BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front) before expanding.
2.  **GEO Statistics & Quotes:** Inject specific, data-backed statistics and direct quotations into the content. Research shows LLMs prefer citing content that contains quantitative data and distinct quotes.
3.  **Fluency & Authority:** Adjust the tone to be "Professional but Conversational" (Turkish: Kurumsal ama samimi). Avoid "SEO fluff." Use semantic HTML (`<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>` for definitions) to help LLMs parse definitions easily.

### STEP 4: BRAND ENTITY ESTABLISHMENT (The "Memory" Layer)
1.  **About Us & Authorship:** Create a plan to optimize the "About Us" and "Team" pages. LLMs judge accuracy based on *who* is saying it. Ensure distinct bios for all contributors are present to satisfy E-E-A-T signals.
2.  **Digital Footprint Strategy:** Suggest a list of external Turkish platforms (dictionaries like Ekşi Sözlük, industry directories, Medium TR, LinkedIn) where we must have a consistent brand description to train the AI's "knowledge" of our brand.

**Actionable Output Required Now:**
1.  Provide the optimized `robots.txt` content.
2.  Provide a template for the `FAQPage` JSON-LD schema with Turkish examples.
3.  Select one core service of my site and rewrite a 200-word "GEO-Optimized" description for it, demonstrating the "Direct Answer" + "Statistics" method.
